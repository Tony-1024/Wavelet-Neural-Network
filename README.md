# Wavelet-Neural-Network
This project attempts to find an improved neural network model for event analysis by combining the wavelet transform and a neural network.
It results from a virtualized cloud platform, by which the experiment log data sets are collected. Based on the log dataset features, I design and implement the new model. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed model is more effective and accurate, it has a better ability for feature attraction and noise tolerance than conventional neural networks.
